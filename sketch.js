    // then give it a z of zero to be flat in the middle

    // if the z value is keeping track of a pretend number as if the circle is actually leaving the screen and coming towards me, the bigger it gets the closer it gets
    //to do that use the map() function - will take any given value that has some range to it
    
    // 2ND VERSION
    // instead of drawing the circle at x and y, make up an x value that will be the star's x value divided by the star's z value
    // the closer it's getting to the viewer
    // as it gets bigger its moving out and to the right
    // repeat with the y value
    //instead of drawing 1 circle, put a loop that -- for each star,

    //and then as it gets closer and closer to the viewer, it gets bigger (10)

    // call the new star variable with it's createVector function/value and placing this at x and y
    // circle(star.x, star.y, d); 
    // 2ND VERSION - instead of drawing the circle at the star's actual value - we'll use the previously created x and y variables
